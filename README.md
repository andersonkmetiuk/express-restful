## What is REST?

**REST** is an acronym for **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer and an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems. Roy Fielding first presented it in 2000 in his famous dissertation. Since then it has become one of the most widely used approaches for building web-based APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

REST is not a protocol or a standard, it is an architectural style. During the development phase, API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways. ([Source](https://restfulapi.net))
